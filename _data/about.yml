title: Welcome!
description:  | 
    My name is Ram√≥n and I am an American Licensed Master Social Worker (LMSW) currently living and working in Brest, France. During my studies I developed extensive experience editing and proofreading academic articles in a variety of fields from behavioral to earth science for submission to peer reviewed journals.  I also worked with many undergraduate and graduate students, for whom English is a second language, to develop their writing skills.
    
    I will work with you to enhance and improve your vocabulary, flow, and style for academic writing in English.
